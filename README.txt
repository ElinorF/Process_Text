This progam processes the text in a file Corpus.txt and saves the processed text into two new files Standard.txt and Lemmatized.txt. The propose of these processings is to make the text in Corpus.txt more easily processed by a computer so it may be used for text mining purposes. 

In the Standard.txt file all the letters in the text have been made to lower case, symbols and digits have been removed as well as function words and links. If the inputed text is in HTML formats, it is formated into normal text.

In the Lemmatized.txt file the text from the Standard.txt file has been processed once more by grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form. 




Files can be found in folder named Data. 



Program could be run by opening it in NetBeans:
